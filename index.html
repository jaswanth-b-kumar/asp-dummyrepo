                <p>The education of today is designed to solve the problems of yesterday, the challenges of tomorrow are
                    going to be unique and different. The current education system is too focused on rote memorization
                    and standardized testing. It does not teach students how to think critically or solve problems. It
                    also does not prepare them for the ever-changing world of work. </p>
                <p>The future of work is going to be very different from the present. Jobs that are currently done by
                    humans will be automated. This means that students need to be prepared for jobs that do not yet
                    exist. They need to be able to think critically and solve problems. They also need to be able to
                    learn and adapt to change. </p>
                <p>The new education system should focus on these skills tomorrow. It should teach students how to think
                    critically and solve problems. It should also teach them how to learn and adapt to change. This type
                    of education will prepare students for the future and help them succeed in the ever-changing world.
                </p>
                <p>Our goal at ClanC is to create students who are fascinated by complexity and solving problems. We
                    will provide the most innovative learning experiences designed to foster student voice, strategic
                    thinking, and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
